#  Molecular Modeler

This Molecular Modeler is a high-performance, cross-platform molecular modeling application built with **Python**, **C++**, **PyQt5**, and **Qt Designer**. It enables users to **build, visualize, and simulate molecules** in real time, combining the speed of C++ molecular dynamics with the flexibility of a Python-based interface.

**This is a preliminary README**

##  Overview

This project bridges the fields of computational chemistry and software engineering to provide a research-grade tool for molecular design and simulation.  
Users can construct molecules, run molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, visualize 3D structures, and analyze energy profiles.

##  Features

###  Molecular Builder
- Intuitive drag-and-drop interface for adding atoms and forming bonds.
- Support for loading `.pdb`, `.xyz`, or SMILES files.
- Geometry validation to prevent impossible molecular configurations.

###  3D Visualization
- Real-time OpenGL rendering (ball-and-stick, space-filling, wireframe, surface modes).
- Interactive camera control and customizable lighting.
- Color-coded atoms and bond highlighting.

###  Simulation Engine
- C++-based core for **fast molecular dynamics** and **energy minimization**.
- Implements Lennard-Jones and Coulombic potential models.
- Configurable simulation parameters (temperature, time step, integration method).

###  Data Analysis
- Real-time plotting of energy, RMSD, and temperature vs. time.
- Trajectory playback and export tools.
- Graphs exportable to PNG or CSV formats.

### Scripting API
- Embedded Python console to automate molecule generation and simulations.
- Extensible plugin architecture for custom computational modules.

### Git Integration
- Version-controlled molecular states and simulation results.
- Automatic commit and rollback for molecular history.
